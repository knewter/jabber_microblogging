== Jabber Microblogging by Isotope Eleven, Inc. (http://www.isotope11.com)

This software is intended to be used to power a single-user jabber-driven 
microblogging site.  For now it's a proof-of-concept (meaning: there's 
no daemon written yet.  This would take two lines of code.).  To see the
potential, do the following:

- Run rake gems:install to install xmpp4r and xmpp4r-simple, if you don't already have them.
- Run the migrations
- Run script/server
- Set the environment variables JABBER_LOGIN and JABBER_PASSWORD to the jabber user you'd like to serve as the site-entry point.  If you don't know what this means, register for a google talk account specifically for this site, and use those credentials.
- Run script/console
- Run the following:

  >> j = JabberClient.new JABBER_LOGIN, JABBER_PASSWORD
  >> j.handle_async_messaging

The thread will then enter a loop, so leave the console.  Send a message to your jabber user, and observe as your site gets updated.


== Alternate summary


http://github.com/knewter/jabber_microblogging/tree/master

This is released under an OISLOCDFABRASDWYWWI* license.  What does it do?

- Hooks onto a given jabber account**
- Puts all posts to that account in a blog (index/show) style listing, newest first.

That's all.  Use it for a microblogging app.  Use it to see how to write a really basic Jabber Client.  If you want more fun Jabber, you can check out https://github.com/knewter/jabber_client/tree for a real-time browser-based jabber client
